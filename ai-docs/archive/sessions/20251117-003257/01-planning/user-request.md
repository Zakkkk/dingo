# User Request

## Task
Check the status of the following tasks and implement them:

1. 🔨 Golden File Integration Testing
2. 🔨 End-to-End Sum Types Validation
3. 🔜 Result Type (`Result[T, E]`)
4. 🔜 Option Type (`Option[T]`)

## Context
Based on the project CHANGELOG.md, the following is already implemented:
- ✅ Sum Types (Phase 2.5) - Enums, pattern matching, match expressions
- ✅ Error Propagation Operator (`?`) - Phase 1.6
- ✅ Plugin System Architecture
- ✅ Basic transpiler and CLI

## Current Status Analysis

### Golden File Testing
**Status**: ❌ **FAILING** (8/8 tests failing)

The golden file tests exist in `/tests/golden_test.go` but all tests are failing with parsing errors:
- Parse errors on `.dingo` files suggesting issues with parameter syntax
- Error: "unexpected token '(' (expected Block)"
- Issue: The golden files appear to use the old arrow syntax (`->`) for return types, but this was removed in Phase 1

**Root Cause**: Golden test files need to be updated to current Dingo syntax (no `->` for return types)

### End-to-End Sum Types Validation
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY TESTED**

According to CHANGELOG:
- 52/52 Phase 2.5 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- 29 comprehensive Phase 2.5 tests (902 lines)
- Coverage: ~95% of Phase 2.5 features

However, the **golden file tests** (which are end-to-end integration tests) are failing.

**Assessment**: Unit tests pass, but end-to-end integration tests need fixing.

### Result Type (`Result[T, E]`)
**Status**: 🔴 **NOT STARTED**

The feature specification exists at `/features/result-type.md` with full design:
- Planned as P0 (Critical - Core MVP Feature)
- Detailed transpilation strategy defined
- Should build on existing Sum Types infrastructure
- Estimated: 2-3 weeks for MVP

**Prerequisite**: Sum types are implemented ✅, so Result can be built as a special enum

### Option Type (`Option[T]`)
**Status**: 🔴 **NOT STARTED**

The feature specification exists at `/features/option-type.md` with full design:
- Planned as P0 (Critical - Core MVP Feature)
- Similar to Result, builds on Sum Types
- Estimated: 1-2 weeks

**Prerequisite**: Sum types are implemented ✅, so Option can be built as a special enum

## Recommended Priority

1. **Fix Golden File Tests** (1-2 hours)
   - Update `.dingo` test files to remove arrow syntax
   - Ensure all golden files parse correctly
   - This validates the transpiler end-to-end

2. **Implement Result Type** (1-2 weeks)
   - Build on existing Sum Types infrastructure
   - Integrate with `?` operator (already implemented)
   - Add standard library methods (unwrap, map, etc.)

3. **Implement Option Type** (1 week)
   - Similar pattern to Result
   - Add combinators (map, andThen, filter)
   - Interop with Go nil pointers

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Fix Golden Tests
- Update golden `.dingo` files to current syntax
- Verify all 8 golden tests pass
- This ensures transpiler quality

### Phase 2: Result Type
- Define Result as builtin enum in type system
- Implement transpilation to Go structs
- Add helper methods (isOk, isErr, unwrap, unwrapOr)
- Integrate with existing `?` operator
- Write comprehensive tests

### Phase 3: Option Type
- Define Option as builtin enum
- Implement transpilation
- Add combinators
- Test interop with Go pointers
- Write comprehensive tests

## Success Criteria

1. All golden file tests pass (8/8)
2. Result type works with error propagation operator
3. Option type eliminates nil pointer bugs
4. Generated Go code is idiomatic and zero-cost
5. Full test coverage (>90%)
